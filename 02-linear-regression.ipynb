    "The learning part of linear regression is to figure out a set of weights w11, w12,... w23, b1 & b2 using the training data, to make accurate predictions for new data. The learned weights will be used to predict the yields for apples and oranges in a new region using the average temperature, rainfall, and humidity for that region.\n",

    "We'll train our model by adjusting the weights slightly many times to make better predictions, using an optimization technique called `gradient descent`. Let's begin by importing Numpy and PyTorch."
